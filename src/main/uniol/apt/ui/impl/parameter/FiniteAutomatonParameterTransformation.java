			+ " every word consists of a sequence of 'a', then 'b', then an optional 'c'. This sequence can"
			+ " be repeated infinitely often or never at all.\n\n"
			+ "As this example demonstrates, single letter events are just entered as is. White space is"
			+ " not significant and gets ignored. Concatenation is expressed by writing some"
			+ " sub-expressions next to each other. If you need an event consisting of more than just a"
			+ " single letter, enclose it in angle brackets like this: <event>\n\n"
			+ "Supported operations are:\n"
			+ " - !a is the negation of 'a', this means any word except a single 'a' is allowed (if the "
			+ "regex contains other symbols, like 'b' or 'c', then they may also occur in this words)\n"
			+ " - a* is the Kleene closure of 'a', including the empty word. This means any sequence"
			+ " of 'a' is allowed.\n"
			+ " - a+ is the Kleene plus of 'a' (without explicitly including the empty word).\n"
			+ " - a{x} means repeating 'a' x times (with an integer x).\n"
			+ " - a{x,} means repeating 'a' at least x times (with an integer x).\n"
			+ " - a{x,y} means repeating 'a' between x and y times (with integers x and y).\n"
			+ " - a? matches either 'a' or nothing, meaning that 'a' is made optional.\n"
			+ " - a|b matches either 'a' or 'b'.\n"
			+ " - a&b means the intersection which matches if both subexpresssion (a and b) match (this "
			+ "example never matches).\n"
			+ " - ~ describes the empty language\n"
			+ " - $ is the language containing only the empty word\n\n"
			+ "The precedence of the operators is:\n"
			+ " ! binds strongest, then * + and ? and repetition with {}, then concatenation, then "
			+ "intersection and at last the"
			+ " union operator. Parentheses can be used to influence the precedence, for example in "
			+ "(a(bc?)+)*.\n\n"
			+ "Finally, comments of the form\n  /* comment */\nand\n  // comment\nare supported.";
