.name "structurally ambiguous coverability 2"
.type LPN
.description "PN with two structurally different coverability graphs. Due to the deterministic order that the PetriNet
class implements (e.g. in getTransitions), the generated coverability graph is actually deterministic. We use different
transition names to generate the different graphs. See structurally-ambiguous-coverability1-net.apt"
